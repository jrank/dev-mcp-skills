# Appian MCP Tool Reference

## Discovery

Appian platform operations are available as MCP tools. The tools are self-describing — inspect their parameter schemas directly for field names, types, and descriptions.

Tool names follow a pattern like `mcp__appian__<toolName>` (the exact prefix depends on server configuration). Look for characteristic tool names like `createApplication`, `createRecordType`, `listInterfaces`, `getProcessModel` regardless of prefix.

This reference covers patterns, conventions, and non-obvious behaviors that tool schemas don't communicate well.

## Key Behaviors

### Updates are partial replacement
Most update tools accept only the fields you want to change — omitted fields are preserved. However, **array fields are full replacement**: if you provide `nodes` on `updateProcessModel`, you must include ALL nodes (not just new ones). Same for `pages` on `updateSite`, `inputs` on `updateInterface`, and `processVariables` on `updateProcessModel`.

### SAIL expressions are strings
Pass SAIL expressions as plain string values. No special escaping beyond normal JSON string escaping. The `expression` field on interfaces and expression rules must start with `=`.

### CSV format for record data
`insertRecordData`, `updateRecordData`, and `deleteRecordData` all use CSV format (header row + data rows), not JSON arrays. Boolean values must be `1`/`0` (not `true`/`false`). Dates use `YYYY-MM-DD`, datetimes use `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`.

### UUIDs are always in responses
Every create tool returns the new object's `uuid` directly in the response. No special output formatting needed — just read it from the JSON response.

## Multi-Step Patterns

### Record type creation sequence
A complete record type setup spans multiple calls:
1. `createRecordType` (with fields) → get UUID and field UUIDs from response
2. `addRecordTypeRelationship` (after ALL related record types exist)
3. `addRecordTypeView` (needs interface UUIDs)
4. `addRecordTypeAction` (needs process model UUIDs)
5. `addRecordTypeUserFilter` (needs field UUIDs)

### Connected system configuration loop
Connected systems use an iterative pattern:
1. `createConnectedSystem` → response includes `schema` (available properties) and `properties` (current values, mostly null)
2. Read the schema to see what fields are available
3. `updateConnectedSystem` with the fields you want to set
4. If you changed a discriminator field (e.g., `authType`), the schema changes — repeat from step 2

### Process model node type discovery
Before configuring unfamiliar node types:
1. `getProcessModelNodeTypeSchema` with the type ID (e.g., `"internal3.write_records_to_source_23r3"`)
2. Use `referenceUuid` parameter to enrich schema with context from a referenced object (integration inputs, subprocess PVs)
3. Use `formInterfaceUuid` for attended nodes to discover form input mappings

### Integration configuration loop
Same iterative pattern as connected systems:
1. `createIntegration` → response includes `schema` and `properties`
2. Read schema, set properties via `updateIntegration`
3. Repeat — schema may change based on operation or discriminator values
4. Properties marked `isExpressionable=true` accept SAIL expressions; for literal strings, wrap in quotes: `'"my value"'`

## Non-Obvious Behaviors

### Process model requirements
- `parentFolderUuid` must be a **process model folder** (from `listProcessModelFolders`), not a regular folder
- `errorAlertGroupName` is required on create — use the app's administrators group name
- Start forms use `inputMap` where keys = PV names (without `pv!`), values = interface input names (without `ri!`)

### Record type relationships
- Must declare both sides: MANY_TO_ONE on the FK table AND ONE_TO_MANY on the referenced table
- Both record types must exist before either relationship can be added
- `sourceRecordTypeFieldUuid` and `targetRecordTypeFieldUuid` must be real field UUIDs from create/get responses — never fabricate them

### Record actions
- `contextExpr` keys must match process model parameter names (case-sensitive)
- `icon` is a Font Awesome hex code (e.g., `"f044"`), not a name (not `"pencil"`)
- RELATED_ACTIONs only surface on record views, not on custom `a!gridField` grids

### Record events
- `configureRecordEvents` returns 409 if already configured — check with `getRecordEventsConfig` first
- Event types are managed after setup by inserting/updating records in the Event Type Lookup record type (UUID from config response)
- Events can only be written via Write Records node in process models — not via `a!writeRecords()`

### testInterface and testRule
- `testInterface` renders the interface and returns the component tree + any `diagnostics.error` entries
- Use it to catch runtime errors that expression validation misses (bad record references, type mismatches)
- `testRule` (type: `EXPRESSION_RULE` or `INTEGRATION`) executes with provided inputs and returns the result

### validateDesignObject vs validateExpression
- `validateDesignObject` checks all expressions on a saved object (by UUID)
- `validateExpression` validates a raw SAIL expression without saving — no `ri!` or record references available unless you provide bindings

## Error Patterns

- **Expression evaluation errors** on properties marked `isExpressionable` — you likely need to quote a literal string value: `'"my value"'` not `'my value'`
- **409 Conflict** — object already exists or is already configured (record events)
- **Validation errors after update** — check that renamed/removed inputs don't break `ri!` references in expressions
- **Missing parent** — folders need `parentFolderUuid`, process models need PM folder UUID, documents need document folder UUID
